Text, Chunk, Feature,
 M: Good morning; my name is Douglas Malenfant.,
 M: I’m with the Samuel Proctor Oral History Program; and today I’ll be interviewing Mr.,
 M: Thomas Coward; former Alachua County city commissioner.,
 C: County commissioner.,
 M: County commissioner; thank you.,
 M: Where were you born?,
 C: Born in Richmond; South Carolina.,
 M: In Richmond; South Carolina.,
 C: Yes.,
 M: When where you born?,
 C: Born in 1920—December 13th; 1922.,
 C: And came to Gainesville when I was five years old.,
 M: Five.,
 C: And reside here since then.,
 M: Where did you go to school for primary education?,
 C: My primary education; high school; was Lincoln High School; and after Lincoln High School; went to the service in the Navy; and after returned from the Navy; I went to Lincoln University in Jefferson City; Missouri.,
 M: When you were interviewed in the past; you once said that being the oldest boy in the family meant that your mother expected you to watch out for you little sisters.,
 M: Did that require more vigilance or patience? M:; after my father died; being the oldest boy son; I was the kind of [inaudible 1:32] of family.,
 M: I looked out for my mother and took care of most of the business for her; as my father would have been doing.,
 M: When you were at Lincoln High School; students there were known as the Big Red Terriers?,
 C: Yeah.,
 M: Yeah?,
 C: Yeah; the Big Red Terriers.,
 M: Terriers are usually known for their; like; fearlessness and tenacity.,
 C: Yeah.,
 M: Yeah?,
 C: Mmhm.,
 M: How did Lincoln High School teachers prepare you for society?,
 C: Very well.,
 C: I; went to school and I worked in the various restaurants around town; but I went to school and the teachers were very dedicated persons.,
 C: And being a youngster and a young fellow; I wasn’t in the athletic program as much; but I was working with the teachers.,
 C: I worked with the debating team for a while.,
 C: But academically; they prepared me to go off to college.,
 C: And after leaving the Service; I went on to Lincoln University.,
 C: And came back; after finishing Lincoln University; I came back and started teaching at the school that I finished high school; the high school that I finished from.,
 M: So their education really prepared you for going on to—,
 C: More not; not academic so much; but prepared me for life; really. C:ah.,
 C: Did the teachers get involved get involved outside of school activities?,
 C: Where they part of your community life?,
 C: Did you see them in social events?,
 C: Not a great deal; but they were involved in the church activities and community activities.,
 C: During the time I finished high school; the schools were segregated; as you know; and there wasn’t a lot of involvement in the total community activities; just the Black community through the churches and social activities and things of that sort.,
 C: And they were very supportive in all the activities that we were involved in; with the football; basketball; the program I was in; what they call the DCT program; diversified occupational program.,
 C: Where they trained a person who may not be going to college but they would possibly have a job.,
 C: But my idea was to pursue a college education; because I was told that the way out of the situation that I was in; a college degree would probably move me upward from where I—the kind of poverty-type situation I was in.,
 M: Who made that clear to you?,
 C: Basically; my history teacher and football coach.,
 M: Is that why you went into social studies?,
 C: Yes; I went into social studies; I got that idea because I was in the Navy.,
 C: And at the time I went into the Navy it was—even though I was fighting a war overseas for the county that I loved; and it was the Old Glory; and the United States of America; and then; I came back.,it was the old glory,existential it/dey,
 C: But after being in the Navy; and being segregated in the Navy; and I felt that I could do better.,
 C: My idea was to try to make a change; and to make a change; the area that would possibly do that C: be in the social studies area; looking at the government; because that seemed to be the area that was keeping from achieving.,
 C: [Laughter],
 M: So it was the Navy that gave you that direction.,
 M: Did you really want to be a teacher; though; when you were in high school?,
 C: No; no; no.,
 C: I had no idea of being a teacher in high school.,
 C: I wanted to get a college education in some area; and didn’t have any idea in what area I would possibly go in.,
 C: But after going into the Navy and experiencing the Navy; and experiencing the government; and getting the idea that the status quo was not what I was satisfied with; that I wanted to come back to make a change; and in order to make a change and go to college; the social study of government and history was what I needed to get involved in; to develop to make the change.,
 M: Thank you.,
 M: So; when where you drafted into the Navy?,
 C: In December of 1942.,
 M: Where did you—where were you stationed?,
 C: I was stationed first in Norfolk; Virginia; then San Diego; California; Walla-Walla; Washington; and from there I went in the South Pacific.,
 M: Okay.,
 M: What was your rank?,
 C: That’s a; the—that was the; what was that?,
 C: In the Navy; what was it?,
 C: What was it in the Navy?,
 C: I’m trying to think; now.,
 C: It’s the same in the Army; it would be a corporal; but it’s a—I had two stripes.,
 M: Okay.,
 C: Yeah.,
 C: [Laughter] C:; my dad was in the Marines; and he’s never really spoken to me much about it.,
 C: He was; during the Vietnam War.,
 C: So; I I don’t have really a strong appreciation for what that means.,
 C: Where were you in relation to other people?,
 C: What’s that now?,
 M: Were you in charge of other people then?,
 M: Were you a leader in the Army?,
 C: No; no; not necessarily.,
 M: What function did you serve?,
 C: It was a segregated Navy; that was the thing about it; you know.,
 C: We were; I was working with the radar outfit.,
 C: That was a communication outfit; but then I was also in the; over what they called the BOC; Bastard’s Officers Club.,
 C: And I was the person who was in charge of making sure that the officers got all the things that they needed.,
 C: Like the club; that’s where they stayed; make sure their rooms were clean; the beds were clean; and that was the situation.,
 C: But yet; at night; when we were short of help; I was in communication—we had what they called scope.,
 C: And in the scope was; they would chart planes coming in; and ships coming in; and they have a certain sound.,
 C: And you plot those on a graph; and it wasn’t like a computer situation right now.,
 C: You had to put a little magnetic thing on the board where you had the 360-degree display; and the area that the planes was coming in from the sound of the plane; you could tell where it was—or the ship—and then you plot that on the board; and you communicate that to the communication headquarters.,
 M: Uh-huh.,
 M: You were in a submarine?,
 C: No; no. C:?,
 C: I was in the Navy.,
 M: Yeah.,
 C: But this was on; this was in the Pacific; we had an area there had a mound that we had built this mound; it was kind of a; it was like an underground; but you couldn’t have underground because the water table in the Pacific was low.,
 C: So we had to build a mound; and camouflage this big mound; and under that you had a Quonset hut in there; and then you put dirt over that; like; and new trees and leaves; like it was—well; a plane couldn’t tell that that was a communication area.,
 C: But we had little towers; you know; sticking out of there among the trees to get the communication.,
 M: Is that; that’s where you worked; where would you have rested?,
 C: That was where I worked; what they call a Argus outfit; that what the Navy call the Argus outfit.,
 C: I was not assigned that in the Navy as a ranking; but that was because of my—I guess my intelligence; and; and because they were short in the situation; they had to get; recruit people and I would come in there—but never recognized as an Argus outfit person.,
 C: I was in the; what they call the mess hall or whatever: tending; or cleaning up the office; place and serving the bar; and serving in the eating; dining room; and all that.,
 M: So; segregation very much part of the Navy.,
 C: Yeah; and you see; that apart make us see: why wouldn’t they give me the kind of rank or recognition in the communication area; rather than assigning me; and the pay and all that; for mess hall?,
 C: I just felt that my intelligence and the way I C: that my knowledge of plotting the this on the scope; why not give me that kind of a ranking; and put me in the Argus outfit?,
 C: But; that wasn’t it.,
 C: So this is the kind of bitterness that I developed then; so I wanted—when I came back to the States; it was a bad situation; because we fought together and we did all these things together.,
 C: And when we got in to Indiana on the train after we were discharged; and we were coming back home; when we got to Indiana; we had to be separated in the coach.,
 C: And we were together all this time overseas and everything else.,
 C: Then; we were separated.,
 C: We had to go to a place; we had to stop to a place to eat—at once; just to give you an idea—to eat; and the White servicemen went into the dining room; but we had to go into the kitchen area.,
 C: And I recall having to eat off a big chopping block area; you used have a big chopping block where you’d cut meat.,
 C: We sat around there and during that particular time; milk crates and all that.,
 C: And we sat around there to eat and take a plate.,
 C: And that had a business in my heart.,
 C: I went out there and did my service; worked in the Navy for this—,
 M: You served your country.,
 C: — for America; for my country.,
 C: And then; my country treated me like that.,
 C: So; that was the kind of—,
 M: That was the; I’m going to go to—,
 C: When you ask me why’d I go into social studies and why I wanted that; that boosted me to try to get training and education and learn more about it.,
 M: Learn about the system that’s; that’s doing this. M:ah.,
 M: Yeah?,
 M: I have a question that might be more relevant to me than anyone else.,
 M: You; you met your wife when you were in eighth or ninth grade; right?,
 M: Well; when you were young; before you went into the Service.,
 C: Oh yes; I met my wife; I think she was in about the eighth grade.,
 M: I’m currently in a long distance relationship—,
 C: Huh?,
 M: I’m currently in a long distance relationship; so I’m; I was wondering; how did you manage the difficulties of being apart for four years?,
 C: Being what?,
 M: Being apart.,
 C: Oh.,
 M: If; that is; if you were together before you were drafted and then—,
 C: Oh no; no; no; we were just; we were friends.,
 C: I didn’t marry her until after I came out of the Service; and after I had gone to; I was in college.,
 M: Uh-huh.,
 M: Did you she move with you to Missouri?,
 C: No; but she came to visit me at Missouri; but we weren’t married then; see?,
 M: Did you keep in contact?,
 C: Oh yeah; we kept in contact.,
 C: She went to A&T state university and—,
 M: You wouldn’t know that from the biographies at all.,
 C: Yeah.,
 C: But I went back; and I went to Lincoln University.,
 C: So we’d write each other and kept in touch.,
 C: We did that in the Service; we did that in the—when we were in college; and we just been together. C:ll that’s; that’s encouraging for me!,we just been together.,null copula,
 C: [Laughter],
 C: Yeah.,
 M: So; the Atkins Warren and Associates that I mentioned earlier today; they say that you do credit your naval experience for your direction in life.,
 M: What aspects of that naval service—,
 C: Who was that?,
 M: Oh; the Atkins Warren; it was the website that I’d mentioned to you earlier that had a biography of you?,
 C: Oh; yeah.,
 M: Which was quite similar to the biography you gave me.,
 C: Oh; yeah.,
 M: They say that you credit your naval experience for your direction in life; like we just established; what aspect of your naval service helped you prepare for the Civil Rights Movement.,
 C: That’s just what I just mentioned: the Navy gave me an insight that there was a discrepancy in what the Constitution of the United States was saying; “We the people of the United States; in order to have more perfect union;” and all that business in the Constitution; what it said.,
 C: And me fighting in the; for the United States; and “I pledge allegiance to the flag;” and all that.,
 C: And then; I was treated inhumanly; you see; in a situation.,
 C: That prepared me; because it gave me an insight that I wanted to dig further to try to change what was happening to me; and was happening in society and other Black males in the community.,
 C: So; my idea was to develop that kind of a change.,
 C: And to develop that kind of change; I C: change the system; the system had to change.,
 C: Because I found out that the government—it was the law!,
 C: If I were to walk into a restaurant; or walk into a White restroom; I would be breaking the law.,
 C: Because the restroom was set up in a situation that you had White women; White men; and Colored.,
 C: That’s what the restrooms was.,the restrooms was.,person number agreement,
 C: So; you talking about unisex restrooms; we had that for years.,
 C: So; these kind of things: that I couldn’t go and eat into the restaurant; I had to ride in the back of the bus—even if we had the bus.,
 C: So; the segregation situation; and I couldn’t figure out that I went overseas; risked my life to come back to a society that did not treat me the same as others.,
 C: I was treated even less than the prisoners of war.,
 C: So you say; “preparing me”; it gave me a mindset that I wanted the change.,
 C: [Laughter],
 M: Yeah.,
 M: So when you took that mindset and you went to college; you must have experienced university differently.,
 M: It was; was it an all-Black school?,
 C: Yeah.,
 M: So; when you were in the institution—,
 C: I lived two blocks from the University of Florida.,
 C: But I couldn’t go to matriculate at the University of Florida.,
 C: I couldn’t go there as a student; University of Florida.,
 M: So would—you didn’t want to go so far away.,
 C: Huh?,
 M: You didn’t want to go so far away.,
 C: Well; I didn’t want to go far away if I could have gone closer.,
 C: I didn’t have to go to Lincoln University out in Jefferson City; Missouri.,
 C: I could have gone to Tallahassee; could have gone to Bethune-Cookman; in Daytona; could have C:o Edward Waters in Jacksonville—it was a good school.,
 C: But I wanted to go where I could—well; while I was in the Service; in the Navy; I went on the campus of Lincoln University.,
 C: Because we had a station not too far away from Lincoln University; and we would go to Lincoln University.,
 C: So; I wanted to go back there to school; because it seemed to be—the professors seemed to give me what I really wanted to deal with.,
 C: And in order for me to really know what was happening to me; to know what was happening in society of Black boys and girls; I needed to have a background and education that would give me the insight on what I needed to do.,
 M: So when you graduated from Lincoln High School—or sorry; Lincoln University—you moved back to Gainesville?,
 C: Yes.,
 M: And you began teaching?,
 C: I began teaching at Lincoln High School; the same school that I graduated from.,
 C: I got a job; I talked with the principal; and the principal knew me and knew I’d graduated.,
 C: And talked with him; and I gave him some of my experiences; as I’m talking to you now; and the teaching.,
 C: And at first; he felt that—he had the same idea and feeling I had; but he wanted me to work within the law.,
 C: Because when I started teaching; I wanted to try to change things even in the teaching situation.,
 C: The textbook that I had to teach from was textbook that the students in Gainesville High School had used.,
 C: And when they get new books; we would get the old books.,
 C: [Laughter] What you had to teach from.,
 C: And I had to teach—I had to teach the things; government and history of this country.,
 C: And what I was C:ed to be teaching from the textbook was not reality.,
 C: Not the reality of what was really happening.,
 M: I assume they didn’t mention people like Fredrick Douglass?,
 C: Huh?,
 M: They didn’t mention people like Fredrick Douglass?,
 C: No; no; no.,
 M: That wouldn’t even be in the textbook?,
 C: That was not been in the textbook.,
 C: So; my students that I was teaching knew nothing about them people; I had to bring that in.,
 C: Now; they have—if insurrection like Nat Turner or somebody like that; that would be in; the civil war and the like.,
 C: You see; what happened; when I was in college; I learned that the movement for Blacks to come here as slaves; I knew that the three-fifth compromise; and the Constitution; and when they were developing or framing the Constitution; the slaves who were here; couldn’t be classed as a whole person; they had to be a three-fifth of a person; because if you were dealing with the population; you couldn’t make all the slaves in there a part of the population.,
 C: They were not citizens of the United States; as such.,
 C: They were classed in the South; as property of they master—the same as the cows; and the horses; and the goats; and all that.,
 C: That was their property.,
 C: And the Constitution of the United States; even in the Constitution and the Dred Scott decision and these things they were talking about; said that Blacks are slaves; had no rights that any White person or any government had to honor; you see.,
 C: And it was not until 19—1896; in Plessy vs.,
 C: Fergusson another— C:arate but equal.,
 C: Separate but equal situation came about; that it erased the Dred Scott decision.,
 C: And all during the Civil War and during the Reconstruction period; you see; all of the Jim Crow laws; all the Black Codes; and all of the things—even though Black folks and Negroes at that time; they were free; they were free then; but they were free without money; and free without land.,
 C: Free without a place to stay.,
 C: So; they had to migrate back to the plantation; because they had no other sort of livelihood.,
 C: And so; then they became what they call sharecroppers; but they weren’t sharecroppers; because the masters hold them back.,
 C: The Reconstruction period; the people still were enslaved; but not legally.,
 C: So; all that period from 1865 up until 1896; and the period in between there; they were lynching and everything; all going on.,
 C: When I went to Lincoln University studying the history from John Hope Franklin; so to speak; who worked up from slavery; and Negro in the United States; and learning that situation; and then coming back and get a job to teach; and none of that—!,
 M: None of what we just talked about.,
 C: None of that was in the history books; because the history book wasn’t written to give people that.,
 C: So then I; what did I have to do?,
 C: I had to write a lesson plan to give to the White supervisor over Social Studies; what I was going to teach.,
 C: And; it got to even the point that one time; my—but; my conscious wouldn’t let me; it would lead me to teach students about what really this whole thing about; and the slaves—and the Negroes; and Blacks; and what everyone called them at that time—was an integral part of the westward movement of the South.,
 C: If there was C:n in their side; everything was centered around the slaves during that particular time.,
 C: When they got new territories; the West began to move; and as they come; they want to know; “What are you—are you going to take the slaves with you?,
 C: Are you going to do the slaves—?,
 C:” I don’t know how much history you know; but these things were not in the textbook.,
 C: We had to talk about Jeffersonians; and talk about Andrew Jackson; Abe Lincoln; and George Washington; and all that.,
 C: But we didn’t talk about Booker T.,
 C: Washington; and George Washington Carver.,
 C: I had to insert that in there.,
 C: When the Civil Right Movement came about; I was teaching.,
 C: And in the textbook; they had “pressure groups;” but the pressure group was the labor unions; and the other pressure group who were eventually pressured people to make laws on their behalf; but SNCC; and CORE; and the NA[A]CP; and all those other groups; were not mentioned as pressure groups.,pressure group was the labor unions;,
 C: But they were pressure groups!,
 C: So I had to; when we were talking pressure groups; they were not mentioned in the textbook.,
 C: So; I was teaching my students there were also other pressure groups that were not mentioned in there.,
 C: And the supervisor of the school came into my classroom; and I had on the board the other pressure groups; other than the labor unions and all that.,
 C: So I had SNCC; CORE; NAACP.,
 C: And she went back and told her superintendent; and told the director of instruction that I was—this was during the Civil Rights Movement—that I was teaching “subversive activity.,
 C:” You know.,
 C: [Laughter],
 M: Yeah; you were just teaching facts!,
 M: [Laughter] M:fact; had a committee to come back to the school and wanted to see me; and wanted know what was I teaching.,
 M: I was teaching insurrection; you know [inaudible 33:06]; get students excited; why was I doing that?,
 M: I was teaching the facts of what the situation was.,
 M: And they said; “Well; you supposed to be teaching social studies; and this is what you supposed to be—you see the script you supposed to—.,you supposed to be,what you supposed,
 M:” I say; “Don’t tell me how to teach.,
 M: I’m teaching—I’m not teaching social studies; I’m not teaching history; I’m not teaching anything: I’m teaching students.,
 M: And It just so happen that the material that I’m using to teach happen to be; in some cases; erroneous from the textbook.,
 M: So; I have to teach the fact.,
 M:” And I told them point blank that; no one in that room sitting around me had more knowledge about history; government; or what I was teaching than I did.,
 M: And I was figuring then that I was going to be fired; but instead of being— gotten rid of; they moved me out of the classroom; put me in the front offices.,
 M: Is that when you became the dean?,
 M: Or as an assistant?,
 C: Yeah.,
 C: I became the dean so that I wouldn’t be directly involved with teaching the students.,
 M: Oh; that answers another question I was going to ask you: if you were planning to become the dean when you started?,
 C: No; no; no.,
 C: They moved me in as the dean of students so I wouldn’t be a part of getting students to riot and all that kind of stuff.,
 C: I would have to quell that situation; so they made me the dean of students.,
 M: Did students want to riot after what you taught them?,
 C: Huh? C: students want to go riot after what you taught them?,
 C: Well; they got an idea that things were not right.,
 C: I had to teach them the facts.,
 C: I had to teach them what the facts were.,
 C: I couldn’t in good conscience be in there teaching them something that was erroneous.,
 C: If I’m a teacher; and I’m teaching you; I’m supposed to give you the facts; and analyze what’s going on.,
 C: And so; but; I was a troublemaker; and a rabble rouser; or whatever you want to call it.,
 C: But anyway.,
 M: How did you experience the closing of Lincoln High School?,
 C: Oh; it was a bitter closing.,
 C: Students decided they would knock down lockers; and leave the campus distraught.,
 C: I happened to be the dean of students at the time; and I had to try to call a group of them together; and I let them know that that’s not the approach that they need to take.,
 C: What they need to do was riot through intellect; but I found out in order to change things; you needed both sides; you need the intellectual part of it; as well as the riotous part of it.,
 C: And then; because then you’re intellectual; and you sit around the table and tried to deal with what was happening in the situation; you could always go back to what the—“If you don’t do this;” what the consequences would be; and why the students were uprising.,
 C: So they need to change these kind of things.,
 M: So; I know your naval experience really affected your direction in life; how did having a daughter change your direction in life?,
 C: It didn’t change a great—it made me more concerned about society; because I didn’t want my daughter to come up in the same way that I did; and have to experience the same opposition.,
 C: And I wanted her to feel that if she was an C:an; and I’ll have the same privilege as anybody else; anyone else; that she was just as good as anyone else.,
 C: And to let her know; and so; education was a vehicle to an upward movement.,
 M: Your mother and father; they taught you lessons about life; right?,
 C: Yes; by precept and example.,
 C: Not by intellect; by precept and example.,
 C: Their hard work—,
 M: Did—did you; pass those on?,
 C: —their hard work; what they had to go through; and the wages they were paid; and the things they had to endure for us.,
 C: It was seven of us in the family; so to survive—,
 M: Did you feel it necessary to pass the lessons you learned from them on to your daughter?,
 C: Yes; but my daughter was pretty much knowing what we were going through; and knowing what I was doing.,daughter was pretty much knowing,
 C: Because she was out along; she went to—I got her to go to P.,
 C:K.,
 C: Yonge; because at that particular time; that was an all-White school connected to the University of Florida.,
 C: And I said; “I want you to go to P.,
 C:K.,
 C: Yonge.,
 C:” And my standing in the community and all that; I figured they wouldn’t deny me; and if I got my daughter in there; that I could get others to go to P.,
 C:K.,
 C: Yonge; also.,
 C: So; that was [inaudible 40:02].,
 C: So my daughter was involved knowing what I had to go through; and she knew what my ideas were.,
 M: When did you meet Neil Butler?,
 C: Huh?,
 M: When did you meet Neil Butler? M:n’d I meet Neil Butler?,
 M: I met Neil Butler at the time that we were all in the Civil Right Movement.,
 M: He was at the; he was working at the hospital.,
 M: And he ran for a seat on the city commission.,
 M: And won that seat.,
 M: And he became mayor of City of Gainesville.,
 M: We were a member of; Gainesville—the Human Relation Council; in which we worked to try to get people elected; or get people to be on boards and commissions.,
 M: Because see; at one time all the various boards of the city and the county; you didn’t have Blacks who represented on there; but they were dealing with Blacks.,
 M: So; I went there; got a seat on the planning board for the City of Gainesville.,
 M: City planning board.,
 M: And Neil Butler was involved in the Civil Right Movement; and he got a seat on the City Commission.,
 M: And I ran for the legislature; but lost that seat; and in the next year—a couple of years from then—Sid Martin; who was a county commissioner; left and went to the legislature.,
 M: And I ran for that seat on the county commission; and no one ever thought that I would even win.,
 M: But I was much more knowledgeable; and much more understanding; and knowing the government; because my major in college was history and government.,
 M: So I pretty well; pretty well was well known; and I could speak better than most of them and put my point over.,
 M: [Laughter] And during the Civil Right—,
 M: That was in [19]72?,
 C: That was in 1974?,
 C: Yeah; 1974.,
 C: Oh right; when I met Neil Butler—and we were working together during the Civil Right Movement; and he won a seat on the city commission.,
 C: And later on I won the seat on the county commission; so we worked together. C:ave an article here from 1968.,
 C: It was on the front page of the Gainesville Sun.,
 C: It says that Neil Butler; Al Daniels; and you were served at ABC lounge on 13th Street; got a mixed drink and talked.,
 C: Why did that story make front page news?,
 C: Well; ABC had a liquor store; and they had—connected with the ABC liquor store; all of them had lounges.,
 C: We could go in and buy liquor over the counter; but we couldn’t go into the lounge to have a drink—which was segregated.,
 C: Our aim was to desegregate all of these eating places; liquor places; and all the establishments.,
 C: And Al Daniels; and Neil Butler; and myself wanted to change that.,
 C: And what happened; we had a person—I’m trying to think of the person’ name now—anyway; who—we were trying to do it through intellect; basically; and the other group was trying to do it through burning places down; or whatever the case may be.,
 C: But anyway; we went to this city attorney; and told the city attorney—or; we went to the mayor of the city of Gainesville; and told him that if they didn’t integrate the lounge on 13th Street; they wouldn’t have a place to integrate it; because there was a group out there was going to destroy it; burn it down; or whatever the case may be.,
 C: And they’ll have a problem on their hands.,
 C: And we said; “You ought to deal with this situation.,
 C: And you won’t have [inaudible 46:12].,
 C:” The mayor told us then; “We’ll have enough policemen and all that around to keep things like that from happening.,
 C:” I said; “Okay; you say you going have that.,
 C:” But I say; “Is that what you want?,
 C: You’d rather do that; than to get the people to integrate?,
 C:” And he said; “Well let me talk to my attorney.,
 C:” Well; the attorney at that time was Ben Montench.,
 C: So we went to the city attorney at that time; and talked with him; and told him that what he needs to do is to integrate C:lace.,
 C: Well he say; “Okay; I’ll tell you what I will do: I will call Jack Holloway;” who was the owner of the ABC stores in the state of Florida.,
 C: And he called Jack Holloway while we were there in his office.,
 C: And Jack Holloway said then he would come down and discuss this with us the next week.,
 C: And so; that’s what he relayed to us.,
 C: We told him to tell Jack Holloway; if he wait until next week; he won’t need to come down; because he won’t have a store.,if he wait,
 C: [Laughter],
 M: Is this the same liquor store that’s still there; next to the Krispy Kreme?,
 C: No; it was across the street; where the food store is; the earth food store?,
 M: Yeah; the Mother Nature one.,
 C: Mother Nature.,
 M: Or; Mother Earth one; yeah.,
 C: Mother Earth; that’s where it was.,
 C: It was across the street.,
 C: So we tell them; they wouldn’t have to worry about that anymore if he going wait ‘til next week.,
 C: So; he said—so; he called back and told him that.,
 C: And so; Ben Montench told him; said; “These people are serious; now; I’m telling you!,
 C:” So; Jack Holloway said; “Well; what we will do; we will integrate.,
 C: So we’ll open up the lounge to them the next day.,
 C:” So we went to the group that was going burn this thing down or whatever; told them to hold off on to it.,
 M: Were they a secret society?,
 C: Huh?,
 M: Was the group that you’re talking about a secret society?,
 C: No; they wasn’t a secret society.,
 C: They was—I can’t think of the guy’s name; but anyway; he was kind of the leader of a group that was ready to burn places C:or destroy places; do whatever.,
 C: It was a riot like you doing all around; because this was during the particular time all these things were happening.,
 C: And so; they said they were going to do it the next day; and they’ll have it open.,
 C: So; the lounge did not open until two o’clock in the afternoon; it start at two o’clock; that’s when the lounge opened.,
 C: So; what we wanted to do was to test them; to see whether they going to be open at two o’clock.,
 C: And we were going in to have a drink; to make sure that it was integrated.,
 C: So when we got there; we had the newspaper people there; and they had the detectives there; and the waitresses; there.,
 C: So we; the three; went in.,
 C: Nobody else was in there!,
 C: Usually at that time; people come in.,
 C: So we went in; no one was there but officials and—!,
 C: [Laughter] And we went in; and this is why I guess; this article—.,
 M: Well; that’s a pretty good story.,
 C: I’ll tell you what; this how—,
 M: Did it work?,
 C: Huh?,
 M: Did it work then; after that?,
 C: Oh; yeah!,
 M: Did it stay integrated?,
 C: They integrated it.,
 C: And then; eventually; what they did—for a while—they closed the lounge!,
 C: Rather than integrate; they closed the lounge.,
 C: [Laughter]— closed it up.,
 M: Wow.,
 M: Doesn’t that defeat their business purpose? M: later on; they opened up.,
 M: And the lounge that they had here; the one out on University Avenue and Waldo Road right here?,
 M: They had a lounge there.,
 M: Well; they closed that up.,
 M: They closed that one up altogether; and used the lounge as a storage room.,
 M: But anyway; we changed that.,
 M: And then; we had a restaurant downtown; we integrated that.,
 M: So Neil Butler and I; and Al Daniels; we were on the side of the intellectual side.,
 M: And then we had another group; who opened up the theater; and then a group of us were appointed to a biracial committee because things were getting out of hand.,
 M: I was one of the members of the first biracial committee; that had the—there may an article.,
 M: There is—oh; the article on the biracial committee?,
 M: Yeah there is; I have that here.,
 C: [inaudible 52:00],
 M: I thought I had it in that pile there.,
 M: You mentioned in the Gainesville Sun that it’s pointless to have equal access to facilities; such as the theater there; or a lounge; when you don’t have the money to pay the fare.,
 M: The Gainesville Sun said in 1977; that your mission was to see that all your brothers have the opportunity to earn that money.,
 M: Has Alachua County fulfilled that expectation?,
 C: Yes; but to a great extent; in other words [inaudible 53:01].,
 C: When I went on the county commission; they had no employees and no person in the—in any leadership role at all.,
 C: Here I am a county commissioner—a county commissioner—and look around; and all the heads; the department heads; and all the assistant heads; and everybody had a role.,
 C: The only role that Blacks had at the county commission then was having two persons: they had assistant to the C: administrator; and they had one person who was in the supervisor of election office.,
 C: And then; we had a person who was under the county manager who was a equal opportunity officer.,
 C: And that is to keep things quiet—you know; to get—at that particular time; the movement was to get a Black person in there; to say; “Well; we got a Black person in there;” to make sure we appease the other person.,
 C: I mean; I could see through all that.,
 C: My experience had been through all that.,
 C: And as a county commissioner; my point was to make sure that every department in there had someone in there had someone in there; some Blacks in there; who going to have some says; and some leadership roles; some involvement in county commission.,
 C: So; that was the movement—and to try to get employees; to get people enough wages and money to go to the restaurants; and to the motels; and bars; and the places that they wanted to.,
 C: So; this was a mission.,
 C: So; what we call economic development; well the economic development kind of thing is still a movement.,
 C: [Laughter],
 M: Speaking of politics; what do you think about the election of Barack Obama?,
 C: What was that now?,
 M: What do you think of the election of Barack Obama?,
 M: Did you think this milestone would come sooner or later than the present time?,
 C: I figured it would come if the right person would come along.,
 C: And I was; when Obama came around; I was optimistic; because he had the kind of main mindset that I had.,
 C: I realized early on that I could not fight the battle of desegregation from the battlefield of protesting and this kind of thing; and with language that was with no substance.,
 C: I figured you had to do it through smartness; intellect; C:t a radical movement; but a coalition of people who were involved.,
 C: And I was optimistic because the way the economy was going; the war was going; that someone who was level-headed to make a change would be able to make a change.,
 C: The only doubt that I had was Hillary; because Hillary was popular in the [inaudible 57:21] and a woman—and the first woman.,
 C: And I figured that that would be the [inaudible 57:28]; but I had enough figured that the Democratic party; if they had any hope that Obama would be the president—because he was smart enough to do it; so.,
 C: But; I did; I thought if he didn’t do it this time; he’d probably do it the next time; but I was probably optimistic on that; along those lines.,
 M: Over your tenure in office; you’ve been interviewed numerous times by the Gainesville Sun; and I assume others.,
 M: Is there anything that reporters; and in your interviews; you’ve never really covered that you’d want to cover; that you’d want to talk about that’s happened that you don’t think people have paid attention to?,
 C: I would say the thing that I don’t think the Sun or the paper really realized; is the methodology that I used to get things done was not the traditional way of how you get things done.,
 M: In politics?,
 C: In politics.,
 C: Here I am; one out of five on the commission; so to speak.,
 C: To get anything done; you had to have the three out of five; or four out of the five; to get it done.,
 C: You could either be on that board and be a loner; and push things that’s C:ing to pass; not going to materialize; or either you get into the mind of those individuals in spite of the Sunshine Law—,
 M: What was the Sunshaw Line?,
 C: Huh?,
 M: What was the Sunshine Law?,
 C: You; three commissioners can’t get together and decide issues or anything pertaining to government or legislation without the public knowing.,
 C: It’s got to be in the public eye.,
 C: In other words; what they would say; you got to be in the sunshine.,
 C: It has to be transparent.,
 C: It had to—all that.,
 C: You and I can’t get together and decide an issue; if I’m a commissioner and you’re a commissioner; we get in the back room somewhere at night and say; “Well; this is what we going to do;” and decide legislation; anything like that.,
 C: I say; in spite of that; we had to convince our commissioner aside to go along with your measures; or what you got to do.,
 C: You have to convince them that this is the right thing to do; you see?,
 C: But now; we’ve had county assistant managers; we’ve had director of personnel; we’ve had the supervisor of jail; the head of the department over personnel; and so; we had these individuals because of my effort.,
 C: And the way to do it; we got these individual Blacks to come on board to get into leadership roles in the county.,
 C: And you couldn’t do that by me getting on a soapbox and saying; you got to do this; you got to do this.,
 C: You got to work with the individuals in a way that you convince them that this is the right thing to do; not to force them to say; “You do this; or else I’m going to do this.,
 C:” What are you going to do?,
 C: You only got one vote.,
 C: So you going to have to work through the system.,
 C: You have to work the C: in order to get the things done.,
 C: So; some of the things that I have done; it’s the method that I used to get things done.,
 C: I don’t have all these plaques on the wall just because I did anything; because the methods that I used to get things done: the finesse; and the maneuvering; and convincing individuals.,
 M: That’s something to be proud of.,
 C: Yeah; this is what you need to do.,
 C: And no one ever had a idea that I would win a seat on the county commission.,
 C: When I went on the county commission; I was the first in the state—not only county—to be a county commissioner.,
 C: I went to the state meeting; the one Black out of all the county commissioners in the state of Florida to be there.,
 C: So.,
 M: I imagine that was a huge room.,
 C: I was in a crystal ball.,
 C: See what are you going to do?,
 C: I could get there and raise all kind of sand; and do things; get nothing done.,
 C: Or either use my intelligence; and persuasiveness; to get people to see that this is the right thing to do and let’s get on with it.,
 C: And a little threat; of course; if necessary.,
 M: Modern psychologists would; would definitely agree.,
 M: [Laughter],
 C: Yeah?,
 M: Modern psychology?,
 M: It definitely—,
 C: Yeah.,
 M: They would definitely would agree that that’s the way to go.,
 M: So.,
 C: And so; you have to gain the respect of individuals for them to come around.,
 C: You know; you can tell a person to go to hell; and they will get all angry; mad and C:hing; and want to fight you.,
 C: And then; you can tell that person to go to hell in such a way and such a tone that they look forward to the trip.,
 C: [Laughter],
 M: Ah; yeah!,
 M:.,
 M: [Laughter] That’s very well said.,
 M: I like that.,
 C: You see; my minor in college was in Psychology.,
 C: [Laughter],
 M: Oh; really?,
 M: My minor’s in religion.,
 C: Is that right?,
 M: Yeah; I’m majoring History; minoring Religion.,
 C: Mine was majoring in History and Government; and minor in Psychology—,
 M: I’m taking an educational psychology course now; that’s just the only reason why I was able to pick that out.,
 M: But that’s; it’s evident that that’s what you knew.,
 C: Yeah.,
 M: Yeah.,
 C: I’d come home at night sometimes and figure out—I want to get something done; and I said; “Now; what strategy do I need to use to get it done?,
 C:” And I threw it around and bounced it around in my head of how; what’s the best approach to do it.,
 C: And to do that; then; you look at the commissioners; you see?,
 C: You got four commissioners; and you study each one of those commissioners’ personality.,
 C: [Laughter] You know.,
 C: How you approach them.,
 C: You can’t approach them all the same way; because they all don’t have the same kind of mannerisms.,
 C: So you figure out how you would approach them.,
 C: And as I say; the Sunshine Law; I couldn’t go ahead; sit in the office; and talk with them and all that.,
 C: But; well; on the telephone sometimes; get on the telephone: “Hi; how you doing?,
 C:”,
 M: Smooth things over? M: know; you maneuver.,
 M: And you throw something out on one way; and talk about the election; and they want to be reelected; and we talk about; I can throw them some votes one way.,
 M: And well; sometimes you may not be—you need those votes.,
 M: And those people; they look at me; and this is what they saying.,
 M: I mean; through all the psychology; and all these strategies then.,
 M: So; strategizing is a big part of politics; and how you handle it.,
 M: And; I retired from the county commission; I was never defeated.,
 M: And many times; I had no opposition.,
 M: And when I had opposition; sometime I had two; three; or four opposing me.,
 M: And I had to have fifty-one percent of the vote; and many times in the primary; I won in the primary; and then in the general election; well.,
 M: Well there were some important individuals.,
 M: Bankers; banker’s sons; University of Florida engineers; mayor of City of Gainesville.,
 M: The mayor?,
 M: Which mayor?,
 C: Well; Cootman Collinger was at one time; he was a University of Florida professor.,
 C: But; Ben Campen; was a banker out in Hawthorne.,
 M: I saw one that—,
 C: One was an attorney.,
 M: I saw one; back in; what was it?,
 M: It must have been in; the [19]70s.,
 M: The gentleman was twenty-seven years old; and; he didn’t have much going for him other than that he seemed to be a like a favorite son.,
 C: Oh yeah; yeah.,
 M: Do you remember that election?,
 M: That’s all right. M:h; but anyway; you know; what I learned in my campaign too; was how you could get people to vote.,
 M: Do want to have a person just to be there?,
 M: Or do you want a person with the experience?,
 M: A person who has the knowledge?,
 M: A person who has the understanding?,
 M: A person who is a go-getter?,
 M: A person who is a mover—a person who is a mover and shaker?,
 M: A person who understand the government?,
 M: A person who’s going be on your side; to look out for your interests?,
 M: You going to bring all the sides together and move this county forward?,
 M: Or did you want to stagnate it; and want more of the same?,
 M: So; before we wrap up; is there anything else you want to discuss; or bring into light?,
 C: Well; I guess this is a start; this is some good information that I have.,
 C: And the reason I asked about; can I get some of the information; because—,
 M: [Holds up newspaper articles] These?,
 C: Not—no; the information after you’ve compiled it.,
 M: Oh; yeah.,
 C: Not necessarily on me as an individual and my movement; but I would probably; write a profile of the growth and development of the City of Gainesville; Alachua County sometime.,
 C: And I would probably use some of the material that you going compile.,
 M: Oh absolutely; yeah.,
 M: Well; we’ll be sending you the copy that I finish transcribing; and then the program will look over it; and do another sweep.,
 C: But I’m sure that there’re other; you going to have other; you’ve talk with other individuals. C:; a lot of the people we’re talking with are part of the Civil Rights Movement here in Gainesville; the Gainesville—,
 C: Yeah; that’s what I’m saying.,
 C: M —Women for Equal Rights—,
 C: Mmhm.,
 M: —are a big part of the interviews that we’re doing.,
 M: So; oh yeah!,
 C: Because see; I’m—I would need; not just from that part; but from all the others.,
 C: In fact; because see; when I put this together I would recognize those people.,
 C: I’ll—,
 M: Here’s a card that will get you in touch—oh; no; that’s that’s study abroad.,
 M: I did study abroad last year.,
 M: That’s study abroad; too.,
 M: I’m sorry; I wanted to give you the Proctor Oral History Program card; but I didn’t bring one with me.,
 M: So; I guess we’re going to wrap up—,
 C: The Civil Right Movement; do you have information on the theater integration?,
 M: The theater integration?,
 M:),
 C: I think it was Charles Chestnut; Aaron Green; and I can’t think of who else it was.,
 M: I think at the Smathers library; they have a lot of that stuff; like a collection of it; and they—,
 C: Because; see; I’m going to the library—,
 M: And the Gainesville Sun; at the Alachua headquarters there; they have the index of the Gainesville Suns on the microfilm.,
 M: And that’s where I found a lot of these articles.,
 M: Before I turn off the recorder; I have to ask you one more question on the tape: do you give this tape; copyright; to the University of Florida?,
 C: Do I give this— C: rights to the copyright for this interview to—,
 C: Oh; yes.,
 C: Oh; yes; yes.,
 M: Okay; thank you.,
 C: That is; I’m pleased to let them accept this and include this in their archives if they wish to.,
 M: That’d be great.,
 M: Okay.,
 M: I’m going to go ahead and stop it.,
